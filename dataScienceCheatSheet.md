## What does Data Science Do?
1) Collects Data
2) Organize Data
3) Analyse Data
4) Visualize and generate Reports of the analysis of data

----

# The Data Relevancy
1) Make a question
2) Observe avalilable data
3) Decide what is important

----

# Data Classification

## 1) By it's Origin
- Voluntered Data (with consent)
- Observed Data
- Infered Data (result of analysis)

## 2) By it's Nature
Defines wich opperation can be performed
- **Qualitative:** Texts, can be subjective, like if something is good or not, descriptions, surveys, questionaires, interviews.
- **Quantitative:**  
  - Discrete: Has a finite number of options, quantity of something
  - Continuous: infinite range of options, changes over time, like medium speed.

## 3) Code Data Types:
- STRING: Text
- INT: an interger number
- FLOAT: floating point number, with decimals
- DATE/TIME: self explicatory
- BOOL: Yes and No. 1 and 0. Binary. Logic juice.

## 4) By it's Structure:
- Structured: a table, Excel, Structured Query Language (SQL), 10 - 20% of all data;
- Unstructured: imagens, PDFs, sound, sensor data, social media posts, Non-Relational Database (No-SQL Database), 80% of all data.

# Data Visualization
The data visualization illustrates, highlites patterns, problems, trends. Always put a title and a legend.

## Methods:
1) Storytelling
2) Reports
3) Charts (graphs, tables, and diagrams)

## To chose the correct method of data visualization we must consider a few points:
1) The number of Variables that need to be shown
2) The number of data points in each variable, that need to be shown. 1) and 2) are considered to understand how clutter the final visualization will be.
3) If changes over time (hours, days, weeks, years)
4) If Correlation or Comparisson are relevant
5) Try and error, be crative.

## Types of Charts:

### 1) Line Chart: Shows trends. Compares 2 data sets, like sales or price x time. Good for high numbers of data points. 
  Best Practices:
  - Time on X-axis
  - Data Values on Y-axis
  - Less lines the better
 Exemple:
![1200px-Pushkin_population_history svg](https://github.com/biomedjung/DataScience/assets/27732278/3b13480a-888d-40d9-8e0c-b6ca5d7ddb94)

### 2) Column Chart: Easy comparissons. Specific data points X data from a similar category. Like Revenue x Different countries.
Exemple:
![Bar-Chart-Vertical](https://github.com/biomedjung/DataScience/assets/27732278/f85a31d7-25c9-42d6-b434-f32b0c593c9c)

### 3) Bar Chart: If the x-axis Labes are text, this chart makes it more readable. For exemple, sales x salesman (name).
Exemple:

### 4) Pie Chart: Total: 100%. Different Values of one variable (smartphone brand used in a country).
Best Practices:
- 10+ gets cluttered, make an "other" or "misc" category
- Order acording to size
Exemple:
![PieChart-01](https://github.com/biomedjung/DataScience/assets/27732278/0a7b026f-f74a-4514-8705-b959018a9c36)

### 5) Scatter Plots: Shows correlation, distribution. Adequate for a large number of data points.
Best Practices:
- Trend Lines can be used
- Large number of data points are necessary to show cluttering and outliers
Exemple:
